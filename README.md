# KSL Notify

An alternative to KSL's Saved Search feature.

Issues with KSL's Saved Search:
1. Sends duplicate notifications for previously seen listings and listings that match multiple searches
2. Does not maintain listing history -- no way to "watch" a listing for a price change
3. Clunky UI -- have to manually view all results to clear the badge counter

This software provides a solution:
* Smart notification system
  * Notifications are only sent for discrete events (e.g. a listing is discovered, or there has been a price change)
